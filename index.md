One of my weaknesses is that I am slow in solving problems.
That is why I have developed my time management skill to start early to get things done over time.
This has been a very successful approach during my school years.
However, now that I am out in the real world, I also have to be fast but also efficient in solving problems.
Especially now that I am looking for a full-time job, technical interview is something that I have to worry about.
I have to think quickly about a solution in a pressured space.
By attempting a difficult interview problem every day and posting my own approach here, not only do I want to overcome my weakness but also help others in seeing a new way of solving a problem.
