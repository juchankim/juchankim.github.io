Welcome! 

One of my weaknesses is that I am slow in solving problems.
That is why I have developed my time management skill to start early to get things done over time.
This has been a very successful approach during my school years.

Now that I am out in the real world, I have to be fast but also efficient in solving problems.
Especially now that I am looking for a full-time job, technical interviews are something that I have to worry about.
I have to think quickly and come up with a solution in a pressured space.
Of course, the interviewers are looking for how I am thinking through and not hoping for me to finish the problem in its entirety.
I will attempt a interview problem every day and post my own approach and thought process here. By doing so, not only do I want to overcome my weakness but also become an expert at explaining my thought process. 

But besides that, I hope to talk about my travels, my experiences, and other little things.
