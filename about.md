I am a software engineer currently based in Los Angeles.
In May 2017, I graduated from UC Berkeley with B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  

I also love to take photos of pretty places. So if you want to see pretty photos all around the world, you can follow me on [instagram](https://instagram/__j_kim_).
