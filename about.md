I have a great sense of color. That's why I love taking photos of all around the world. Check out the amazing places that I have been to on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/__j_kim_). 

I also enjoy editing videos. I was part of a Korean broadcasting station on campus ([BerKast](https://www.facebook.com/UCB.BerKast/)). If you know Korean, I strongly recommend to watch our videos - a lot of cool contents that I am very proud of being part of.

Besides taking photos and editing videos, I love solving jigsaw puzzles, riding my bike to the beach, and listening to instrumentals from movies or dramas.
