<b>ICELAND</b> (Nov 4, 2016 - Nov 7th, 2016)

<p> This was the country that I really wanted to go to after this Korean show called "Youth Over Flowers". So when I went to London for study abroad, I had Iceland in mind. I luckily find friends to go with over Reading week (or Dead Week) and my hope was to see the Jökulsárlón (glacier lagoon) + aurora.

I guess when I went, it was still early to see northern lights. I went out every night to observe the sky but most of the time there, it was either cloudy or rainy. Unfortunately, I was not able to capture that perfect aurora I had in mind. However, I still saw little fainted greens in the sky so I am ok with it. Given time in the future, I will definitely visit northern countries again to see aurora. 

Not only that, on our way to the glacier lagoon, we had a flat tire (when I was driving) and we, only in our early 20s, had to fix it ourselves. It took the whole afternoon and we missed the perfect shot of sunset over the glaciers.

However, the trip was still great. Although we were not able to drive around the whole country, we still saw the Golden Circle as well as Black sand beach (Vik). Iceland was full of amazing waterfalls and peaceful landscapes.

The capital, Reykjavik, was great too. Very hip with amazing murals and amazing town-scape.

One thing that was sad about Iceland was that the food was so expensive. Cheapest things were hotdogs so that's what we ate most of the time. We did go to restaurants but wow. It would be over 20-30 dollars per person for a small plate. Next time, I should be well prepared with all my groceries so that I don't have to spend money for food. Well. I will think about that when I actually have the chance to go again.
