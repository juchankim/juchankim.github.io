<h2>Maya</h2>
After taking graphics course, I really got interested in learning animations. It seems really cool applying the theories that I have learned like rigging to build cool animation projects. It is amazing that people have built such cool features to make animations easier and more natural. I went through different tutorials and it is so cool!!! 

Below is using Joel L. Anderson's Dobby character (http://joel3d.com/) and applying rigging. I was very excited to make an animation of a character that I love! Dobby is a free elf!
