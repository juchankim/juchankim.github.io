<b>UNITED STATES</b> (Jan 1st, 2007 - current)

<p>Jan 17th, 2007 is the date when my family moved to the United States.<br>
Thinking that it would be something temporary, I now see USA as my home.<br>
Attending middle school, high school, and university here in the United States, I have experienced so much. <br>
Coming from a country that has no diversity, I was really shocked and amazed by the different colors and backgrounds of people here. 
This place is really a home of diversity, equality, and acceptance. Although my travelling experience here was very limited, I still was able to see the diversity of landscape. Cities have their own personality and nature shows up in different form. <br>

<b>Los Angeles</b> (Jan 1st, 2007 - current) : 
(in my opinion) the best city in California. The only downside of Los Angeles is the lack of natural green and forests since the region itself is a desert. However, the beach is just beautiful. Santa Monica is so iconic. I am surprised that I actually do not own a photo of Santa Monica - especially since I can access it so often. Personally, Santa Monica is too crowded. My favorite place to see the ocean is by riding my bicycle along the Marina Del Rey bike path that eventually leads to the ocean.

As you can see from the photo above, the sunset looks so beautiful and peaceful here. Maybe I am biased since my home is LA. But, many acclaim LA as the best place to get Korean food. Apparently, they even taste better than food in Korea. (Honestly, I haven't been to too many Korean restaurants here because my mom cooks so well and no one can honestly top her. However, places that I have been to definitely taste pretty good and authentic.)
